                                        commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court,
                                        compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4
                                        inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46
                                        cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the
                                        court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.
                                        A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line,
                                        when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or
                                        designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free
                                        throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if
                                        regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play
                                        (overtime) is mandated.</div>

                                            rhythmic
                                            speech, and street vernacular". It is performed or chanted, usually over a
                                            backing beat or musical accompaniment. The components of rap include
                                            "content"
                                            (what is being said e.g. lyrics), "flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery"

                                            hop music commonly associated with that genre; however, the origins of rap

                                    <div class="vertical__text">Robbery is the crime of taking or attempting to take
                                        anything of value by force, threat of force, or by use of fear. According to
                                        common law, robbery is defined as taking the property of another, with the
                                        intent to permanently deprive the person of that property, by means of force or
                                        fear; that is, it is a larceny or theft accomplished by an assault. Precise
                                        definitions of the offence may vary between jurisdictions. Robbery is
                                        differentiated from other forms of theft (such as burglary, shoplifting,
                                        pickpocketing, or car theft) by its inherently violent nature (a violent crime);
                                        whereas many lesser forms of theft are punished as misdemeanors, robbery is
                                        always a felony in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two. Under English
                                        law, most forms of theft are triable either way, whereas robbery is triable only
                                        on indictment.</div>
